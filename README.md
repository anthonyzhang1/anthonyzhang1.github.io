# Anthony Zhang's Website

### URL: https://anthonyzhang1.github.io/

Anthony Zhang's Website is where I present some information about myself and my works. \
Each work has their own GitHub page where the technical details and the source code are kept -- the website is for providing background information and images of the work.

Anthony Zhang's Website uses React for the website and GitHub Pages to host the website. \
The website was made in March 2023.

### About this repository:
The `main` branch contains the website's React source code. \
The `gh-pages` branch contains the React app built from that source code.
